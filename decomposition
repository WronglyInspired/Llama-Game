Llama Runner Game
The Player (a Llama) is running through a wilderness, and must jump up and down
 to avoid Obstacles (Cacti). The Player slowly speeds up, and dies if it hits
 an obstacle.

The Llama will have a speed attribute, but will remain stationary on the screen
 while the world flies past. It can jump up and down.



Possible trialling things:

- jumping mechanic: variable or fixed?
- obstacles: a list of obstacle instances, or a pygame sprite group?
- how to do speeding up?
- ducking?
